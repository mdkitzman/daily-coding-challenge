# The Problem

Given a string, determine whether any permutation of it is a palindrome.


## Example

For example, `carrace` should return true, since it can be rearranged to form
`racecar`, which is a palindrome. The word `daily` should return false, since
there's no rearrangement that can form a palindrome.

## Details

Write a function `containsPalindrome` that will take a string and return a
true if the word can be rearranged into a palindrome, and false otherwise.

```typscript
containsPalindrome(text: string) : boolean
```
