# The Problem

Given an array of numbers, and an input number, can you determine if any numbers add
up to the given number.

## Example

Given the array `[10, 15, 3, 7]` and the number `17`, you would return `true` since
`10 + 7 = 17`

## Details

Write a function `sumExists` that will take a number and an array of numbers and return
if the array contains two numbers that add up to the provided number.

```typscript
sumExists(sumNumber: number, candidates: number[]) : boolean
```

## Variation

Can it be done in one pass?
