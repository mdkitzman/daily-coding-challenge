# The Problem

Given 2 strings, find the longest common substring between the two strings

## Example

Given the input `"ABCD"`, and the string `"ACDEB"` the expected output would be
`"ACD"`.

## Details

Write a function `longestCommonSubstring` that will take 2 strings and return the 
longest common substring between the two, or an empty string if none exists.

```typscript
longestCommonSubstring(firstString: string, secondString: string) : string
```
